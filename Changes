 [TODO]
 - Thinking of adding Moo support of some kind, but Moo is notedly
   different. Esp: lazy/lazy_build.
 - I considered making a Moo-style-for-Moose version, but then considered
   that implementing 'lazy' would have to know what the attribute was
   called to set the respective Moose builder value, so that is Too Hard.
 - Please, if you're reading this and have suggestions/feedback, feel free
   to hit me up on IRC =).
