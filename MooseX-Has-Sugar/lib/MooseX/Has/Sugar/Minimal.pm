=head1 NAME

MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal - Less Sugary Syntax for moose 'has' fields than L<MooseX::Has::Sugar>

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.0300

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a legacy variant of L<MooseX::Has::Sugar> which only exports 'ro' and 'rw' functions,
     the way L<MooseX::Has::Sugar> used to with C<:is>;

    use MooseX::Types::Moose qw( Str );
    use MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal;

    has foo => (
            isa => Str,
            is  => ro,
            required => 1,
    );
    has bar => (
            isa => Str,
            is => rw,
            lazy_build => 1,
    );

=head1 CONFLICTS

This module is not intended to be used in conjunction with L<MooseX::Has::Sugar>.

We both export C<ro> and C<rw> in different ways.

If you do however want to use them in conjuction, specific imports must be done on L<MooseX::Has::Sugar>'s side to 
stop it exporting different ro/rw. Any of the below should be fine.

    use MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal;
    use MooseX::Has::Sugar qw( :attrs );

    has foo =>( is => rw , lazy_build );

    use MooseX::Has::Sugar::Minimal;
    use MooseX::Has::Sugar qw( lazy_build );

    has foo =>( is => rw , lazy_build );

=head1 FUNCTIONS

These you probably don't care about, they're all managed by L<Sub::Exporter> and its stuff anyway.

=over 4

=item rw

returns C<('rw')>

=item ro

returns C<('ro')>
