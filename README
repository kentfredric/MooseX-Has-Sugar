MooseX::Has::Sugar

"MooseX::Has::Sugar" and its related modules provide simple, short-hand,
bare-word functions that act as declarative macros for greatly
compacting "Moose" "has" declarations, in a similar way to those
provided by the declarative subroutines provided by "MooseX::Types"

This provides:

*   Less typing when defining "has" constraints

*   Faster, more skim-readable blocks of "has" constraints

*   Perl Language Level syntax validation at compile time
